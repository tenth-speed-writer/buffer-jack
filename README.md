The Turn System

Each tick:
* Get lists of mobiles whose _action_cooldown are and aren't greater than zero
* For those who are, reduce it by 1
* For those who are not, randomize (random.sample()) the list order and prompt each entity for an action

Having a .tick() method on mobiles might be helpful
